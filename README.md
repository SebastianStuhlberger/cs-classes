# generic c-sharp classes

A small collection of mostly universal abstract classes that can be used to improve code architecture.
These classes were fully developed by me, usually for game-projects that I was involved in.

The [self-contained-classes directory](https://github.com/SebastianStuhlberger/cs-classes/blob/main/self-contained-classes) contains well refined classes, while the [unity-scripts directory](https://github.com/SebastianStuhlberger/cs-classes/blob/main/unity-scripts) contains classes that were pulled directly from old projects, mostly without ever getting the refactoring they deserve.
